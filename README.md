# Project Introduction

This is a fictional test project meant to asses the code quality you can deliver. You will receive git credentials, which will get you all the data you need. You will find in the git the project, a DB dump (in the “!Database” folder) and the design screens (in the “!Design” folder). A helpful hint for you, once you set up the project locally make sure that you have full write permissions on the “/assets” and “/protected/runtime” folders within the project.
Should front end development not be a strong point for you do not linger on it, just solve the functionality as described below, HTML and CSS skills are not mandatory for this job, but would be a welcome bonus. Please concentrate on quality and keep in mind this is to be treated as an expandable project, so keep your code flexible. Have fun!

# Project Requirements

1.	You must have an AMP environment up and running on your machine (apache, mysql, php)
2.	You must have a git client installed

# Project Task

1.	You are to extend an existing project, this project is fictitious and will have no real world application.
2.	The project emulates a library where users will be able to lend out books.
3.	Your task is to extent the functionality as described in the design screens:
    •	Create a relation between users and books
    •	Manage all interactivity via fast ajax calls
    •	Integrate the add User functionality via an ajax form 
    •	Limit books per user to 8
    •	Please take in account that for the sake of simplicity we assume there is only one copy of every book available
4.	Implement the Design screens into HTML/CSS supporting modern browsers

# Project Goals

1.	Flaunt your skills in PHP and/or HTML/CSS
2.	We deliberately chose a Framework you are not likely to know, Yii. It’s an easy framework and thoroughly documented online. (http://www.yiiframework.com/) We will assume this is your first contact with the framework and will asses your delivery time accordingly. Just show us you understand how MCV works and you will do fine.
3.	You may choose to only do half of this project for example only the backend if HTML/CSS is not jour strong point. Please start with the task you are most familiar with. In this project we are looking for quality, just show us what you do best so we know what kind tasks we can assign to you.
4.	The task presented are considered easy to moderate, as such we will be looking more into how you solved the task and not just check that it was done.
5.	Plan all your steps considering that this project might be expanded upon in the future, write your css and your php accordingly and keep it flexible.
